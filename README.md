This is the README.md file for the Data205 project.
I'm analyzing data sets from dataMongomery.gov focused around alcohol licensing and sales to minors.
The investigation will explore the relationship between locations where alcohol violations were recorded, specifically violations for the sale of alcohol to minors, 
the locations of public high schools, and the locations of crimes involving alcohol. 
Enforcement of appropriate alcohol sale practices should benefit the public by having greater protections for our youth 
and lower incidence of crimes involving alcohol in the vicinity. The analysis will identify whether differences in funding to the ABS correlate to
differences in violation reporting. Lower incidences of crime involving alcohol and greater enforcement could justify prioritizing funding for ABS to ensure public safety.
